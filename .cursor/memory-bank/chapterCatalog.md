Chapter Design Notes
--------------------
â€¢ Every chapter contains:
  - An immersive lore description tied to its zone.
  - One to three coding challenges with associated test cases in JSON.
  - A dedicated autograder (`check.ts`) that validates user solutions.
  - XP reward that feeds into the rank system.
  - Replay support via Manual Mode once unlocked.

â€¢ Completing a chapter updates `xp-tracker.json`, the markdown world map, and may unlock subsequent zones.

â€¢ Master Project chapters (e.g., #12, #30) integrate multiple disciplines for a capstone experience.
