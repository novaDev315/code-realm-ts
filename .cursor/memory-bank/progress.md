ðŸ“ˆ Progress â€” Code Realm TS

What Works
----------
â€¢ Project specification captured in Memory Bank (this import).
â€¢ Core TypeScript game engine scaffold (Game loop, Player, Chapter system) implemented and running via Node & Docker.

In Progress / Planned
---------------------
| Phase | Task | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Game engine + Player class | Completed |
| 2 | Chapter1 module + recursion checker | In Progress |
| 3 | XP system, map, and reset logic | Completed |
| 4 | Chapter loader + chapter2/3 content | Next |
| 5 | System Design chapters 7â€“12 | Future |
| 6 | Optional web UI (React + WebSocket) | Future |

Known Issues / Risks
--------------------
â€¢ No actual source code implemented yet â€” risk of scope creep if features added before core engine is stable.
â€¢ Autograding approach (Jest vs. custom runner) still undecided.

Next Deliverables
-----------------
1. `src/engine/Game.ts` â€” orchestrates loop & menus.
2. `src/engine/Player.ts` â€” handle XP/rank/progress.
3. `src/engine/Chapter.ts` (abstract) and `ChapterLoader.ts`.
4. Chapter 1 implementation & tests.

Status Timestamp
----------------
_Updated after Milestone 1 scaffold implementation_

Future Chapter Plans
--------------------
â€¢ Core chapters 1â€“12 are defined for the MVP (see `chapterCatalog.md`
