# Code Realm TS

A gamified command-line RPG for mastering algorithms and system-design in TypeScript.

---

## ðŸ“œ Overview
Code Realm TS turns your terminal into a fantasy world where each coding challenge is a chapter in an epic journey. Earn XP, level up ranks, and defeat boss encounters while sharpening real-world engineering skills.

* **Language**: TypeScript (Node 20)
* **Architecture**: Fully OOP, chapter-based engine
* **Runtime**: `ts-node` or Docker
* **Progression**: Story Mode (linear) + Manual Mode (replay)
* **Autograding**: Built-in test harness validates solutions instantly

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay at a Glance
| Rank | XP Required |
|------|-------------|
| Initiate | 0 |
| Apprentice | 100 |
| Adept | 300 |
| Architect | 600 |

1. **Story Mode** â€“ Tackle chapters in order; unlock lore and new zones.
2. **Manual Mode** â€“ Replay completed chapters or simulate failure for practice.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
### Prerequisites
* Node.js â‰¥ 20 **or** Docker

### Local (Node)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start game in dev mode
npm run dev           # alias: ts-node src/main.ts
```

### Containerised
```bash
# Build & run interactive container
docker compose up
```

## ðŸ”§ Development
* Each chapter lives in `src/chapters/ChapterN.ts` and extends the abstract `Chapter` class.
* Autograding scripts reside beside player quests (e.g., `quests/chapter1/check.ts`).
* Add new chapters by creating a class, tests, and updating `chapterCatalog.md` â€“ no engine changes required.

### Testing
Jest is planned for the test harness. Configure tests under `__tests__/` or within chapter folders.

Run lint & test:
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```
